## 3. How We Use AI & Your Data

### 4.2. License to Us
You grant us a perpetual, worldwide license to use your Inputs and Outputs **solely to provide and maintain the Service** (e.g., to render the image in your gallery).

### 4.3. Similarity Disclaimer
Due to the nature of AI, Outputs may not be unique. Other users providing similar prompts may receive similar generated images.
